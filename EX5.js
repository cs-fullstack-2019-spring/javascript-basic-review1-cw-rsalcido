// BONUS: Keep prompting until the User actually enters a number (HINT: Look into using NaN)
//
// Exercise 5
//
// Write a JavaScript program that does the following:
//
//     Prompts the User to enter their outstanding loan amount as a number (LOANAMT)
// Prompts the User to enter the number of months in which they want to pay off the loan (NUMMONTHS)
// Calculates the monthly payment they need to make and logs it to the console as To pay of a loan of LOANAMT it will take NUMMONTHS months
// BONUS: Keep prompting until the User actually enters a number for both loan amount and number of months (HINT: Look into using NaN)
//
// NINJA BONUS: FIZZBUZZ
//
// FIZZBUZZ is the classic Programmer's challenge often used as part of job interviews.
//
// User inputs the ending maximum value (e.g. 100)
//
// Your code should start at 1 and then iterate (count) each number up to the maximum number entered by the User.
//
//     If the current number is evenly divisible by 3 you should log FIZZ and the number
// If the current number is evenly divisible by 5 you should log BUZZ and the number
// If the current number is evenly divisible by both 3 and 5 you should log FIZZBUZZ and the number
// Otherwise, just print the current number
